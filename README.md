# PRODIGY_GA_05
#  Neural Style Transfer App

This project is part of **Prodigy InfoTech's Data Science Internship â€“ Task 5**, where I built a Streamlit-based web app that applies **Neural Style Transfer** using a pre-trained TensorFlow Hub model.

##  Overview

This application allows you to upload a **content image** and a **style image**, and then it generates a new image that blends the content of the first with the artistic style of the second.

###  Features

- Upload any two images via a simple web interface.
- Perform Neural Style Transfer using a model from TensorFlow Hub.
- Real-time image generation and preview.
- Deployed locally using Streamlit.

##  Technologies Used

- Python 
- Streamlit 
- TensorFlow & TensorFlow Hub 
- NumPy 
- Pillow (PIL)
